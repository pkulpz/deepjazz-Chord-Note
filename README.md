Note: deepjazz has been succeeded by [**songbird.ai**](http://songbird.ai) and is no longer being actively developed. 

This project can generate a new jazz music using an existing jazz's Chords and Notes.


### Instructions
Run on CPU with command:  
```
python generator.py
```


This project can get the chords and notes information automaticly from jazz file you input. This is the main improvement of jisungk's project.

To use another jazz music, you should only change the file path in function data_info in generator.py file.
